# Linear-Regression-Model-to-Predict-the-Profits-of-the-Resturant-Franchise
I had collected data of  restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet.  I would like to expand your business to cities that may give your restaurant higher profits. The chain already has restaurants in various cities and I have data for profits and populations from the cities. 

Visualize your data
It is often useful to understand the data by visualizing it.

For this dataset, you can use a scatter plot to visualize the data, since it has only two properties to plot (profit and population).
Many other problems that you will encounter in real life have more than two properties (for example, population, average household income, monthly profits, monthly sales).When you have more than two properties, you can still use a scatter plot to see the relationship between each pair of properties.

Your goal is to build a linear regression model to fit this data.

With this model, you can then input a new city's population, and have the model estimate your restaurant's potential monthly profits for that city.
